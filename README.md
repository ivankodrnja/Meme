## MeMe

Meme is Project 2 towards iOS Developer Nanodegree from https://www.udacity.com/

## Overview

This is an iPhone app that enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. The user is able to share the photo on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email.
